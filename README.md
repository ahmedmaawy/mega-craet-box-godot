## Inspiration

Mega Craet Box (Not Crate Box - Craet Box) is a game inspired by [Super Crate Box](http://supercratebox.com/) from [Vlambeer](http://twitter.com/Vlambeer). Super Crate Box is a very enjoyable game - but have had a lot of problems getting it to work lately - including on Linux (which is my primary OS) and Steam. So basically personally seeing such a lovely game getting lost slowly has motivated me to recreate a close to similar experience and grow it.

So decided to replicate the experience in the best way possible. And in a way that can be enjoyed on Mac, Windows and Linux. It may not exactly be at par with the original but I guess it can get there some day.

## Mega Craet Box

Mega Crate Box is built around very similar mechanisms as Super Crate Box.

High scores (leader-board) for this game can be found online at: [https://megacraetbox.vercel.app/](https://megacraetbox.vercel.app/)

## The Web Backend

The Web Backend is hosted on Firebase - it is used mostly to keep track of the leaderboard.

The Dashboard that displays highscores is [available on this repository](https://github.com/ahmedmaawy/mega-craet-box-web) - and is hosted on vercel.
